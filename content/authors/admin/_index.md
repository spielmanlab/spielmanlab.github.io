#bio: Welcome to the Spielman Lab! We conduct research broadly within the fields of computational molecular evolution and evolutionary genomics. We use scientific computing, bioinformatics techniques, and biostatistics to study how DNA and protein sequences evolve. In particular, we are interested in the phylogenetic modeling frameworks used to describe sequence evolution.
